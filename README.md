# pizza-sales-analysis-powerbi-sql
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales over a year using Power BI and Microsoft SQL Management Studio. Key metrics and insights, such as KPIs, daily and monthly trends, category/size breakdowns, and top/bottom sellers, are visualized in Power BI dashboards. The data was processed in SQL for optimized analysis and then connected to Power BI for visualization.
